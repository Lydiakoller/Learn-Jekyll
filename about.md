drew her with a wand, a pineapple

tiptoe, she tried and tried  
in juvenilia, while he traced out  
like a vagabond cadet  

how to shade a sphere, a forearm,  
rhyme a couplet,  
or not rhyme but only feel  
underlying ambiguity  

these days she works in line  
and color and impossible  
foreshortening shapes  
signal in their dreamscape  

he's fractured sometimes  
sometimes clearly verbed, so  
siblings fourteen years apart  
share distortions edging into  

an art
