Longer ride, uncomfortable quiet, she’s Goth or whatever such kids are called nowadays, stares straight ahead into the Joshua Trees, white against a tan desert road, so what do you do?, recovering after a first fail joking BreakingBad-style that I’ll Uber anywhere as long as it’s not to bury a body in the desert, I’m catwoman at Comicons, which is weird, a career?, yes, the world over, China and Japan, Vancouver, going to Honduras, how odd, my friend’s a seamstress, she’s got a booth, I wear the costume, it’s what I’m famous for.  Goodbye.
