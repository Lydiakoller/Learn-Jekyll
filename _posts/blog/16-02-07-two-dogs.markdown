She breaks a heel getting in, she’s got two dogs in her purse, like Paris Hilton on crack, really on crack, she doesn’t know her address, a boyfriend inputs it remotely, handing her through, glitter headband, makes me circle back, go back, go back, I’ve dropped my valise, a sparkling hot mess, studiously so, perhaps, which in fishnet all akimbo, teetering everywhere, I am compelled to watch through the rearview mirror to see if I can catch the flicker of something inside her facade, ending up, in the end, with the same sort of nothing as Beau Brummel.
