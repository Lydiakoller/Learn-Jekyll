When young, the silent  
directions of upstream and down  
crackled those nights, wind  
mewling beneath the bridge,  
lights on the house a hill above me,  
reeds sighing for spring with a hollow voice.  
   
We’d water the rink, the lengths of hose  
heated tap-water warm, steam rising over cold  
black and skate-scarred sheaves.  When the wind  
blew strongest, we’d step in the slush to freeze  
our boots in place, kept from blowing away.  
    
Now old, a part of me, or most  
has fixed itself there and looks  
upstream and down almost exactly  
as far as ever.
