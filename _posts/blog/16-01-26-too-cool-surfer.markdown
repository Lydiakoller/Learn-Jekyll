Stone steps, or moonlight, one of those breaks, somewhere cooler than me, barefoot, tugging at his own hair, no address, so I ask, like just up the “1”, okay, I can do that, we go, most often they ride in front, very untaxilike, promotes conversation, store-clerks and private jet salespeople, the niece of a Green Bay Packer, but this guy, this dude, or whatever, he’s too good, says little, looks out the window as if the window were mirrored, as if his own face long since failed to amuse him anymore.
